Hello there! I'm **Abhin**, a versatile full-stack software engineer at **Honeywell Connected Enterprise**.

I'm an open-source enthusiast Usually in my spare time I roam around in the realms of **React**, **Redux**, **Docker**, **Flutter**, **GraphQL**, **DevOps**, and much more. I love connecting with peers, I'm always eager to discover new technologies and share my knowledge with others and I also like to brew some malt

I'm a passionate open-source enthusiast. During my spare moments, I explore the vast realms of **React**, **Redux**, **Docker**, **Flutter**, **GraphQL**, **DevOps**, and many more technologies. Connecting with fellow enthusiasts is something I truly enjoy, as I'm always eager to delve into new technologies and exchange knowledge. Additionally, I have a penchant for brewing some fine malt beverages and When I'm not immersed in lines of code, I'm capturing moments that transcend time – all through the lens of my trusty drone and camera.


### 🙋🏻‍♂️ Alright, here's the scoop on my tech playground 🎮
* First off, I've got a knack for turning product ideas into visual wonders using **Figma** – it's like digital arts and crafts! 🎨
* When it comes to building top-notch apps, I'm your go-to with **Javascript**, **TypeScript**, and **React**. I'm all about those pixel-perfect vibes! 💻✨
* Styling? No sweat! I groove with **CSS**, **scss**, **tailwind**, and even make the front-end pop with **Styled Component**. It's like giving your app a stylish wardrobe. 👗💃
* Wrangling front-end state is my jam! I've worked wonders with **MobX**, **React Context**, and even summoned the mighty **Redux**. Oh, and I've dash of **React Query**. 🧘‍♂️📦
* I've even dabbled in crafting mobile apps using **Flutter** and **Ionic-3**.
* Not just apps – I've also cooked up a bunch of **REST** and **GraphQL** API services using **.Net Core** and **SpringBoot**.
* Hosting-wise, I've set up shop on **Openshift**, using **Docker** and **K8s** or **Firabase** like a pro.
* If containers aren't your jam, I've got a trick up my sleeve with the **Azure Function app** for going **serverless**.
* Plus, I've played around with cool stuff like **NodeJs**, **Webpack**, **Webworker**, and even got in on some **Kafka** action with side projects and POCs.

Whoa, am I a tech wizard or what?! 🧙‍♂️ Don't worry, I'm not a one-person army – just got super lucky to dive into all sorts of exciting projects at both Honeywell and Think201.

Kicked off as a Mobile App Developer, and guess what? Microservice architecture wanted to be BFFs! We've been cooking up some pretty cool things using different tech flavors. 🍰

And then, out of nowhere, Event-Driven Architecture showed up like, "Hey, let's party!" 🎉 And, well, I couldn't resist. I mean, who am I to say no to a good tech time?

So yeah, call me the "Jack of Many" – but my true superpower is my adaptability and lightning-fast learning skills. 🚀📚 Ready to conquer the next tech frontier!
